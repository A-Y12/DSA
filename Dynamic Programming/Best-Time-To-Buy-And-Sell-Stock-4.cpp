// WITH K TRANSACTION

/*
OBSERVATIONSðŸ’™:

There are 3 states possible:
skip
buy
sell
but since I cannot buy unless I sell the previous stock, hence for every day I just have 2 possiblities:
buy or skip in case no stock is in hand

sell or skip if we have already bought a stock

the recursive tree would look something like this:
image

there are 3 changing parameters: k, index, buy/sell state
rather than making this 3D dp question with 3 changing parameters, we can combine k and buy/sell state into one variable called transaction ID.
for k = 3, transaction IDs are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here, 0 means the point where first buy should happen and 1 is the point where first sell should happen. Likewise, 2 is the point where 2nd buy should happen,.... so on and so forth.
so if the transaction ID is 3 than it means I have done 1 transaction completely and I have bought 2nd stock which need to be sold.
even signifies stock is to be bought and odd transaction ID signifies stock has to be sold
